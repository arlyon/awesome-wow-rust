Excellent resources for world of warcraft private servers in rust. There is still a lot of room for experimentation with a few differing approaches.
This resource will act like a hub to share ideas and experiment with alternatives.

## Servers

- [wrath-rs](https://github.com/Victov/wrath-rs): the most complete implementation, with movement in the world 
- [azerust](https://github.com/arlyon/azerust): an experiment into a modular high-tech server platform with interfaces over graphql and [tokio-console](https://github.com/tokio-rs/console)

## Libraries

- [wow-srp](https://github.com/gtker/wow_srp): wow's flavour of SRP-6 authentication
- [wow_login_messages](https://github.com/gtker/wow_messages/wow_login_messages): datastructures for the wow login page
- [wow_message_parser](https://github.com/gtker/wow_messages/tree/main/wow_message_parser): a pest-based parser for wow packets
