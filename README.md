Excellent resources for world of warcraft private servers in rust. There is still a lot of room for experimentation with a few differing approaches.
This resource will act like a hub to share ideas and experiment with alternatives.

## Servers

- [wrath-rs](https://github.com/Victov/wrath-rs): the most complete implementation, with movement in the world 
- [azerust](https://github.com/arlyon/azerust): an experiment into a modular high-tech server platform with interfaces over graphql and [tokio-console](https://github.com/tokio-rs/console)
- [wow_vanilla_server](https://github.com/gtker/wow_vanilla_server): experimental 1.12 server with no external dependencies other than `cargo run`.

## Libraries

- [wow-srp](https://github.com/gtker/wow_srp): wow's flavour of SRP-6 authentication
- [wow_login_messages](https://github.com/gtker/wow_messages): datastructures for the wow login server
- [wow_world_messages](https://github.com/gtker/wow_messages): message definitions and types for wow world server
- [wow_message_parser](https://github.com/gtker/wow_messages/tree/main/wow_message_parser): a pest-based parser for wow packets
- [wowm](https://gtker.com/wow_messages/): a DSL for the world of warcraft protocol, aiming to cover client / server for versions 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x
- [wow_dbc](https://github.com/gtker/wow_dbc): library for reading 1.12, 2.4.3, and 3.3.5 DBC files
- [wow_chunky](https://github.com/bigglesss/wow_chunky): library for reading 1.12, 2.4.3 and 3.3.5 binary files (ADT, WDT, BLP, BLS)
- [divert](https://github.com/0xFounders/divert): Rust bindings for Recast pathfinding library
- [namigator-rs](https://github.com/gtker/namigator-rs): Rust bindings for the namigator WoW pathfinding library
- [dev_wow_auth_server](https://github.com/gtker/dev_wow_auth_server): Authentication server that allows everybody with a matching username/password combination to log in. Used for skipping writing an authentication server and going directly to writing a world server.
- [wowdbdefs-rs](https://github.com/gtker/wowdbdefs-rs): Library for reading [WoWDbDefs DBC file definitions](https://github.com/wowdev/WoWDBDefs).

## Tools

- [forge](https://github.com/bigglesss/forge): a pure-Rust WoW renderer, using wow_chunky to parse WDT/ADT/BLP files and render them with Bevy
- [idewave-cli](https://github.com/idewave/idewave-cli): a world of warcraft client as a cli.
